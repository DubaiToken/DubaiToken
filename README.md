## Project description
The World's First Hotels Reservations Crypto-Payments Service Token.

This repository contains the Dubai token smart-contract.

## Contract Specification

ERC20 is an official protocol for proposing improvements to the Ethereum (ETH) network. 
ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the proposal identifier

### ERC20 Token

The public interface of PAX Standard is the ERC20 interface
specified by [EIP-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20.md).

- `name()`
- `symbol()`
- `decimals()`
- `totalSupply()`
- `balanceOf(address who)`
- `transfer(address to, uint256 value)`
- `approve(address spender, uint256 value)`
- `allowance(address owner, address spender)`
- `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value)`

And the usual events.

- `event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)`
- `event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)`

Typical interaction with the contract will use `transfer` to move the token as payment.
Additionally, a pattern involving `approve` and `transferFrom` can be used to allow another 
address to move tokens from your address to a third party without the need for the middleperson 
to custody the tokens, such as in the 0x protocol. 

### Pausing the contract

In the event of a critical security threat, ERC20 has the ability to pause transfers
and approvals of the token. The ability to pause is controlled by a single `owner` role,
 following OpenZeppelin's
[Ownable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/5daaf60d11ee2075260d0f3adfb22b1c536db983/contracts/ownership/Ownable.sol). 
The simple model for pausing transfers following OpenZeppelin's
[Pausable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/5daaf60d11ee2075260d0f3adfb22b1c536db983/contracts/lifecycle/Pausable.sol).
